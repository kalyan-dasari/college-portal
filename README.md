As a part if event organizing we may face some heavy work to plan multiple events and collect names from manual paper listing. And personally i feel like we don't know what are the events conducting in the college.
 Information may be passed or missed so i thought of doing something that is not there in my college website

I came across a idea like giving the event details and all information there in the college portal

where students can register there and the coordinator will get the details
this register buttons are not fully developed with backend..
so we can integrate google sheets or DataBase so store but sheets is preferred to manage well
